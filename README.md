## Introduction

### The Project
Searching for gas stations is hard but finding affordable gas prices is even hard enough.

Petrohub is a web application that provides drivers(or anyone really) with realtime gas prices information in the locale. My county people have been 'gas hopping' on various gas stations in a bid to find a cheaper gas price offing. No more that, with PetroHub you can easily find any gas station in the area and its latest price offings.

### The Context
This project is a Portfolio Project that marks the conclusion the Foundations Year at ALX. This was a solo project.

## Architecture
### Overview
This web app was built using Front end technologies(HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript). A lot of work was put into developing a front-end that was simple but easy to use.

### HTML5, CSS3 AND JAVASCRIPT
For this project, I decided to use the above front-end technologies and take it as a learning opportunity to study them and master them further.

All the pages in the app were built using HTML5. Maps incorporated the openstreet maps API feature.

### Static javascript files
I decided to use static files as a database for the apps data. Every time a location or gas price is changed, I would have to update it accordingly in the app. Though burdensome, this would help in making the information provided by the app more secure and trustworthy.

This app has no login or sign up feature instead it is open to anyone looking for gas price information
